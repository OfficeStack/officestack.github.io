                We jumpstart development on open-source solutions to business software needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of the existing solutions carry a lot of baggage: They often have a few years to couple decades of legacy code. They're often bloated and unfriendly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our aim is to make software that helps <em title="Yes, corporate America, employees are people too.">people</em> be more productive and happier employees.

                Every office uses software to operate day-to-day, but not everyone can afford SAP, Salesforce, or other such products so they're stuck using something much worse.
            </p>
            <p>
                We want to provide a open-source counterweight to such products without usage restrictions and licensing fees.<br /><br />If we can make it work well &amp; look sharp, than doggone it we're sure as hell gonna do it.
